/* Layer 1: Directive
 * Goal: Establish global styles, including font definitions and base theme.
 * Inputs: Tailwind CSS directives.
 * Edge Cases: Font loading failures (will fall back to system defaults).
 * Outputs: Base styling for the application.
 */

/* Layer 2: Orchestration
 * This file serves as the main entry point for global styles.
 * It imports Tailwind's base, components, and utility layers.
 * Custom fonts (like Poppins or Inter) would be defined here if a CDN or local import was used.
 * For now, we'll rely on Tailwind's defaults and ensure dark mode styling is correctly handled.
 */

/* Layer 3: Execution
 * These are the standard Tailwind CSS imports.
 * The 'dark' class will be dynamically added/removed from the <html> element by App.js
 * to enable dark mode styling, leveraging Tailwind's dark mode variant capabilities.
